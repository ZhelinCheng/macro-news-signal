# Macro News Signal

An intelligent market analysis skill that transforms real-time global news and key macro indicators into actionable investment insights.

## Overview

Macro News Signal is a tool designed to convert fragmented global financial news and macroeconomic indicators into structured, actionable investment decision support data through automated collection, deep parsing, sentiment analysis, and multi-dimensional aggregation.

## Workflow

```
News Request → Source Identification → Automated Collection → Parsing & Analysis → Signal Generation → Aggregation Output
```

## Step 1: Source Identification

Identify appropriate news sources based on request:

| Asset Class | Main Sources | Type |
|-------------|--------------|------|
| Equities | 10JQKA, Bloomberg, CNBC | RSS |
| Fixed Income | Fed Speeches, Indices, BoE | RSS/API |
| Commodities | EIA, OPEC, Metals Bulletin | Web |
| Forex | Central Banks, MNI | Web |
| General Macro | WSJ, FT, Economist, Zaobao | RSS |

## Step 2: Collection

Use appropriate methods based on source type:

- **RSS Feeds**: See `references/news_apis.md`
- **Web Pages**: Prioritize agent-browser skill if available for dynamic access; otherwise use default scraping method
- **APIs**: See `references/news_apis.md`

Example curl request from `references/news_apis.md`:

```bash
curl 'url' \
  -H 'accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7' \
  -H 'accept-language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -H 'user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/146.0.0.0 Safari/537.36'
```

## Step 3: Parsing & Analysis

This stage uses NLP to extract core variables from unstructured text:

1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Automatically identify specific assets (e.g., $NAS100$), economic indicators (e.g., $CPI$, $TIPS$), and key persons or geographic regions.
2. **Sentiment Polarity**:
   - Hawkish/Dovish Analysis: Quantify policy bias for central bank communications
   - Bullish/Bearish: Calculate text sentiment score $S$ based on financial dictionaries
3. **Forecast Comparison**: When news involves economic data releases, automatically compare "actual" vs "expected" values and calculate deviation.

## Step 4: Signal Generation

Transform parsed analysis into quantified investment logic:

- **Impact Level**: Classified as Flash (instantaneous volatility), Secondary (minor impact), or Trend-Setting (major trend signal)
- **Indicator Relevance**: Calculate current news mapping intensity to specific assets (e.g., gold vs 10Y TIPS yield divergence)
- **Logic Validation**: Automatically detect divergence signals such as "bullish exhaustion" or "overheated sentiment"

## Step 5: Aggregation

Aggregate analysis results in the following multi-dimensional ways to generate structured reports:

- **Time Window**: Daily summary, weekly in-depth review
- **Core Themes**: Inflation, GDP, Employment, Central Bank Dynamics, Geopolitics
- **Region**: United States, China, European Union, Emerging Markets
- **Asset Class Recommendations**:
  - *Buy*: Strong bullish signal with reasonable sentiment
  - *Hold*: Neutral signal or data vacuum period
  - *Sell*: Structural bearish or extremely overheated sentiment
